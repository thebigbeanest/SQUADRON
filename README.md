# SQUADRON
A basic shooter game with a full-CRUD server behind it in order to handle requests to read lore, enemy information, and etc from a database.

Goals and User Stories:
- Create, Seed, and be able to read from the squadronDatabase.
- The overall goal is not to create a new game, but rather just use the idea of the game as a background in order to create a Bestiary for it.
- The user will be able to access this database on the front end to search for and view information, with style that makes it look better than the bare minimum.
- The user will be able to navigate easily from the bestiary page and nested sub-pages without having to refresh the page.
- The user will be able to clear the data on the page. 
- The user should also be able to access the game area (Even if not functional) without interference with the database files.
- The user can exit the game area and return to the main menu in order to access the database without having to refresh the browser.


Stretch Goals:
- Add sound effects for the buttons clicked in main menu and bestiary.
-
